## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project really helped me improve my understanding of web responsiveness. I initially tried to solve everything with flexbox, but ran into some challenges. That's when I realized CSS grid could better handle the layout issues I was facing. While I got it as close as I could, I know there's still room for improvement, and I have more to learn.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to continue improving my understanding of:

- Mobile-first vs. desktop-first approaches
- Handling responsiveness efficiently with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Optimizing layouts for different screen sizes
